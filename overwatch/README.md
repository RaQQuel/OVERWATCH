# Overwatch

## Documentation locations

It is best to start with the main repository README, which is available [here](../README.md).

Generally, most functions and classes include a python docstring documenting the basic arguments and
functionality. However, it is often worth glancing at the code if there is a particular question.

### Processing and Trending in a Subsystem

Additional documentation on processing and trending systems is available in the
`overwatch/processing/detectors` readme. This covers the module from the perspective of adding a new subsystem
to the Overwatch project. It describes the various steps and options available.
