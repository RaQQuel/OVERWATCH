# HLT Receiver Scripts

These scripts are used on a particular system to receive data from the HLT. If you are reading this file, then you almost assuredly **DO NOT** need these scripts.

This requires the `feature-hltdev` branch in AliRoot, as well as `autossh`. This code has not been written to be portable, since it is only used on one system for one purpose.

These scripts should be symlinked form the data directory.
