# Notes on the Overwatch logo

The SVG was creating using `Inkscape` and is saved as a `Inkscape` svg. The selected logo (in the top left of
the comparison) is grouped on a different layer than the logos. 

Note that the event displays and firewwatch tower are both composed of a set of lines or curves which were
grouped together. They can be modified by ungrouping, but be certain to regoup after modifications are
complete.
